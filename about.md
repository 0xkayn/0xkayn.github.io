I'm just a dude interested in web security, drones, philosophy, and science fiction.<br>
I enjoy playing ctf with my team (OrderofShadows), drone racing (getting into this one but working on some drone software before), playing chess, and reading (currently reading the expanse series - Nemesis Games was amazing...) <br>
I also very occasionally stream on twitch: twitch.tv/0xkayn
